In this Service registry project I have used eureka server to register the micro services to communicate with each other

This project has been developed using the below softwares Java 17, Spring-boot 3.1.4 and Maven.

Steps to run: Download this project Import as Maven project in any IDE Do a clean build Start the application

Note: This project has to start first because this is the service registry and all microservices created will register here.
